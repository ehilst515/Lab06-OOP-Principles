# Lab06-OOP-Principles

*Author: Enrique Hilst*

## Description

This is a console application that uses OOP principles to create animal objects made in different classes, and tests inheritance for proper properties and methods. 
It also includes interfaces, which are a lighter and more flexible way of providing objects properties and methods. Interfaces can be used across many classes, such as bat being a mamal that can *swim* and *fly*.
The swim and flight speeds and distances can be specified in every mamal.
